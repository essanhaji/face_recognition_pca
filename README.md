# Olivetti Face Recognition Using PCA




### Olivetti Dataset
<b>Brief information about Olivetti Dataset :</b>
- Face images taken between April 1992 and April 1994.
- There are ten different image of each of 40 distinct people
- There are 400 face images in the dataset
- Face images were taken at different times, variying ligthing, facial express and facial detail
- All face images have black background
- The images are gray level
- Size of each image is 64x64
- Image pixel values were scaled to [0, 1] interval
- Names of 40 people were encoded to an integer from 0 to 39





### Principal Component Analysis
Principal component analysis is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components.





### Requirements
- Python 3.7 64bit




### Installation
- Get the package from PyPi :
- All requirement that you will need its exist in ``requirements.txt`` so you just need to run this command :
```
!pip install -r requirements.txt
```



### Test
Congratulation.
- Open the notebook ```main.ipynb``` and edit it as you want.<br/>
